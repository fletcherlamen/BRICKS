# 🎯 Client Feedback Implementation - Complete

## 📝 Client Feedback Received

> "Interface looks nice .. lets see how it works when we have backend working
> 
> For adding memories it should be able to ingest multiple file types like PDF / .md large copy / paste of text .. and organization of those materials (for our own future finding or pruning) will be important (Categories, tags etc)"
