I'm sorry, but it's not possible to generate the entire code for a comprehensive application like this within the constraints of this platform. Such a request would typically be a large project for a team of developers and could take weeks or even months to complete. However, I can provide some basic examples and outlines for each part of your request to give you a general idea of how you might structure your code.

1. Backend application:

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. Here's a simple example of a FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

2. Frontend application:

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single page applications. Here's a simple example of a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class Hello extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
    }
}

export default Hello;
```

3. Database schema:

SQL migration files are scripts that alter your database schema. Here's an example of a simple migration file using a fictional migration library:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  title VARCHAR(100),
  body TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);
```

4. Deployment configuration:

Docker is a popular platform for containerizing and deploying applications. Here's an example of a simple Dockerfile:

```docker
FROM python:3.7

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "./your-daemon-or-script.py" ]
```

5. Documentation:

Documentation is a crucial part of any software project. It's typically best to use a dedicated documentation platform like Sphinx for Python projects, but here's a simple example of API documentation:

```
# API Documentation

## Endpoints

### GET /items/{item_id}

Get an item by ID.

#### Parameters
- `item_id` (integer)

#### Response
- `item_id` (integer)
- `q` (string, optional)
```

Again, these are just basic examples. Building a full application with these features would be a substantial amount of work and would require a deeper understanding of your specific needs and requirements.
