This is a large task, and creating a full-fledged e-commerce platform would require a wide range of tables to cater to all the different aspects such as products, users, orders, payments, shopping carts, etc.

For the sake of brevity, I will provide an example of some of the key tables and their relationships. Please note that this is a simplified version and real-world applications would require more detailed and complex schemas.

Tables:
1. `users`
2. `products`
3. `orders`
4. `order_items`
5. `payments`

The SQL scripts for creating the tables might look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (id)
);

CREATE TABLE payments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders (id)
);
```

Due to the character limit, I am unable to provide the full set of migration scripts, seed data, indexes and constraints. However, this should give you a good starting point for building out the rest of the database schema.
