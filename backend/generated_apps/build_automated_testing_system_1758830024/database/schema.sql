As an AI model, I don't have the capability to generate the complete database schema and migrations for an automated testing system as it requires a detailed understanding of the specific project requirements. However, I can provide an example of a simplified schema and some SQL scripts based on some assumptions. 

1. Database Schema Definition

Let's consider that we have two main tables - `users` and `tests`. The `users` table stores information about users while the `tests` table stores information about the tests taken by the users.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    password VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE tests (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    test_name VARCHAR(100),
    test_status VARCHAR(50),
    test_result VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

2. Migration scripts

Migration script for adding a new column 'created_at' to the 'tests' table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tests ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP;
```

3. Seed data

Seed data for 'users' and 'tests' tables:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, email, password) VALUES 
(1, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com', 'password1'),
(2, 'Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com', 'password2');

INSERT INTO tests (id, user_id, test_name, test_status, test_result) VALUES 
(1, 1, 'Test 1', 'completed', 'passed'),
(2, 2, 'Test 2', 'completed', 'failed');
```

4. Indexes and constraints

Creating an index on the 'email' column of the 'users' table:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX email_index ON users(email);
```

5. Relationships

As we have already defined the foreign key relationship in the 'tests' table while creating it, we don't need to define it again.

Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't cover many aspects of an automated testing system like test cases, test steps, etc. Also, it doesn't include many best practices like not storing passwords in plain text, etc. The actual database schema and migrations would be much more complex and should be designed based on the specific requirements of your project.
